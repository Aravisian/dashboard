Dashboard-GTK-Theme

I was examining the interior of a vehicle, with the silver trim and leather tones, the backlit indicators... And I was thinking, it is too bad that we cannot theme our computers to look like our vehicle dashboards.
Clearly, we like the look... With elegant angles and complimentary tones, many vehicles look quite elegant. The reason why we cannot: Car dashboards are generally pretty static. Computer window widgets resize all over the place.
But, I decided to take a stab at this anyway. Here is the result.
Not a lot of angles to this, since - it doesn't work well. I actually struggled to name this enough that I asked several people for suggestions. In the end, I am uploading this under its working title of simply "Dashboard."

To Install (Bionic or Focal Repo) Cinnamon, XFCE (MATE D.E. Coming Soon):
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:aravisian/gtk-theming
sudo apt update && sudo apt install dashboard

OR... If you are on a rolling or non LTS release, use the .deb self installer:
